# PortofolioProject_DataVisualizationPython

### In the EURUSD project I face several problem that I still haven't found the solution yet, but the outcome is what I want so I keep going.
#### I will still keep finding the problem for SettingWithCopyWarning and FixedFormatter should only be used together with FixedLocator

### In the Popular Data Science, I show my ability to clean and visualize the data.

### In Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In, not that different with the popular data science, but it show how I process the data to be used for the marketing team of data class/institution. It's for data analytics role
